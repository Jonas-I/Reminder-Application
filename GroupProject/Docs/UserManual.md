This Application creates and manages Reminders for a User when they need to be reminded on sensitive or important information at a specific time.

## How to Use

1. When the Application is launched, the User will be present a User interface to create and manager their Reminders.
    - When the User presses/clicks on the create button (Plus Sign) they will be taken to a new screen where they will be able to create a new Reminder.
    - The Reminder to be created will be held to certain constaints. It must have a specific type e.g "Appointments", and a description e.g "Dentist Appointment"
    - The User has the option to add an Alert to their Reminder to specify a time and date they want to be reminded by their phone.

2. When the User has created their Reminders, they will be able to manage those Reminders.
    - The Reminders will be displayed based on their Types e.g all Reminders with the type of "Appointments" will be listed under the List Appointments.
    - To view all Reminders under that list, the User must press/click on the list itself and all the Reminders of that type will be shown under that list. 
    - The User will be able to check off reminders by pressing the checkbox next to a specific Reminder
    - Once the User checks off a Reminder, it will turn to an inactive state meaning that the Reminder is done and the User no longer wants to be notified or track that Reminder.
